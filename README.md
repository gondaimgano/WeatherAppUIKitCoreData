# WeatherAppUIKitCoreData

# Gondai Weather App



## Getting Started

This app demonstrates the power of UIKit and a pragmatic Architecture design in a Xcode Project
1. You are able to refresh while still in the app
2. If Offline it will save the last successful weather forecast into CoreData
3. An extra - you are able to view all your locations that you have travelled via the MKMapView ( to see the power of it you need to change the location via the simulator feature)
